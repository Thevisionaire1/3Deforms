# Welcome to 3Deforms. Sample and 3D mesh package.

![title](assets/graphics/docs/banner.png)

This project was created from the "empty" project template.
In Defold version 1.9.2.

This project contains 3D meshes in their simplest shapes and prototype textures in basic colors that will help you model your next 3D video game.


Note: To add 3D collision shapes, physics must be enabled in 3D mode in
["game.project"](defold://open?path=/game.project) Physics tab.

### Don't worry about the UV's!

All UV's are oriented as best as possible and compared in two 3D modeling programs to correctly apply textures.

## How to use it?

Create an empty project.

![empty](assets/graphics/docs/empty.png)

Create a collection.

![collection](assets/graphics/docs/collection.png)

Add a node (game object).

![go](assets/graphics/docs/go.png)

Add a model to the node (can be DAE or glTF).

![model](assets/graphics/docs/model.png)

Select it from the preset folders.

![form](assets/graphics/docs/form.png)

Add the base material to the model.

![material](assets/graphics/docs/material.png)

Add the main texture.

![texture](assets/graphics/docs/texture.png)

Place it to your liking.
